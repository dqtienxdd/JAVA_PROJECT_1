## About the project

Our project is about Zicke Zacke Huehnerkacke board game. We implement the game into Java.

## Game Rule

* Setting Up: Shuffle the 12 octagonal tiles and place them face down in the middle of the table. The 24 egg-shaped tiles are positioned around them to form a circular track. Each player chooses a chicken and places it on one of the egg shaped tiles. The chickens should be arranged so that they are spaced as evenly as possible.

* Taking Turns: Players take turns by looking at the next space in front of their chicken. They then choose an octagonal tile from the center of the table and show it to all players. If the picture on the tile matches the picture on the next space, they can move their chicken forward to that space. The octagonal tile is placed face down in its original position. Players continue moving their chickens as long as they choose the right tile to match the next space. If a player makes a mistake, their chicken stays on the tile it has reached, and the next player takes a turn.

* Overtaking: If a chicken catches up to another chicken, it can attempt to overtake by finding the matching tile for the space in front of the other chicken. If successful, the overtaking chicken jumps in front and steals all the feathers from the overtaken chicken. The player's turn continues, and they may attempt to move further by finding the matching tile for the next space. A chicken can overtake multiple chickens in one go if they are standing in an unbroken row.

* Winning Condition: To win the game, a player must collect four chicken feathers of different colors . Once a player achieves this, they are declared the winner.
